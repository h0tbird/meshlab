# Istio

Istio is an open-source service mesh platform that provides traffic management,
policy enforcement, and telemetry collection for microservices applications. It
helps in improving the reliability, security, and observability of
service-to-service communication in a cloud-native environment. By integrating
with popular platforms such as Kubernetes, Istio makes it easier to manage the
complexities of microservices architecture.
